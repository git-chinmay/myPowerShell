PowerShell Script:-

function SkypeProcess()
{
    try{
        
        if(get-process -name "Lync" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue)
        {
            $p = get-process -name "Lync"
            stop-process $p
            write-host "Skype process cleared" -ForegroundColor Yellow
        }
        else{write-host ""}
        
    }
    catch {"No Skype process running: $_" }
}

while (get-process -name "Lync" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue){
    SkypeProcess
}

write-host "All Skype related process cleared" -ForegroundColor Green
